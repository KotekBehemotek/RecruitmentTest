Hello

Hope this code will be found interesting ^^
In the HTML form task i decided to avoid JS to mark my knowledge of maybe lesser known aspects of CSS (pseudoclasses).
I still acknowledge without JS it is impossible to secure inputs completely. In some browsers input would not be valid after pasting data.

Thank You
Have a nice day
